# ✋Virtual Screenshots using Hand-Capture✊

Just one day I was scrolling this social media app where I came to see a content of promoting a mobile tech ad where they are grabbing the picture as a screenshot and sending it over to other using hands communication. This made me curious about the tech and also make me decode the process. From that I have decoded that its using the hand gesture mode to capture the screenshot replacing the alternative win + prtsc/ ctrl + shift + s etc shortcuts. So with the help of python language, I began to code for the hand gesture and replacement of the os shortcuts. And now came with the hand gesture based Screenshot system in laptops. To make it develop further I need collaborators to make the air transfer a success....
